# Different Authentication and Authorization Methods - Python 

## [Project Link](https://www.freelancer.com/contest/2242894)



<h2> Description </h2>

I need help showing how to use various authentication and authorization methods for secure software systems. These should be implemented using python to show the various methods.

You could implement them using 1 application and show the different methods, or use different python files to show the different methods running separately. It would be nice to have a database with a user interface to show everything.

My suggested idea is to have a Flask app with different pages showing how different authentication schemes work (Passwords, OTP, Physical Tokens/JWT, SSO, Biometric/face recognition, Multi-factor, Passwordless, etc), as well as different authorization methods for accessing data (Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)).
You may also suggest a different approach to showcase different methods instead of Flask and be more creative.

\# Note that you will need to submit a zip file with all python codes and html/css/js as necessary.
